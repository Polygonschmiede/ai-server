# Auto-Suspend Mechanism Fix Documentation

**Fix Date:** 2025-10-30
**Fixed By:** Claude Code
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED AND TESTED**

---

## 🚨 Critical Bugs Found and Fixed

This document details the critical bugs found in the Auto-Suspend mechanism and the fixes applied.

---

## Problem Summary

The auto-suspend mechanism was **completely non-functional** due to multiple critical errors introduced during the refactoring process. The services would never install, never start, and would fail silently.

---

## 🔴 Bug #1: Missing Installation Functions (CRITICAL)

### **Problem:**
The functions to install Auto-Suspend and Stay-Awake services were **completely deleted** during refactoring and existed **nowhere** in the codebase.

**Missing Functions:**
```bash
configure_auto_suspend_service()  # ❌ DELETED
configure_stay_awake_service()    # ❌ DELETED
```

**Evidence:**
- `install.sh:453` called: `configure_auto_suspend_service`
- `install.sh:455` called: `configure_stay_awake_service`
- Both functions existed in `install.sh.pre-refactor.backup` (lines 734-818)
- Both functions were **NOT** in current `install.sh`
- Both functions were **NOT** in any helper library

**Impact:**
- Installation would **crash** with "command not found"
- Services would **never be installed**
- Auto-suspend would **never work**

### **Fix Applied:**

✅ Added `configure_auto_suspend_service()` to `scripts/lib/power.sh`
✅ Added `configure_stay_awake_service()` to `scripts/lib/power.sh`

**New Implementation:**
- Creates `/opt/ai-server/` installation directory
- Copies Python scripts from source to `/opt/ai-server/`
- Generates systemd service files dynamically
- Executes `systemctl daemon-reload`
- Executes `systemctl enable --now` to start services
- Properly handles disabled services (cleanup)

**Location:** `scripts/lib/power.sh:115-254`

---

## 🔴 Bug #2: Wrong Paths in Service Files (CRITICAL)

### **Problem:**
Service files referenced non-existent paths.

**ai-auto-suspend.service:23**
```ini
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /opt/ai-server/auto-suspend-monitor.py
WorkingDirectory=/opt/ai-server
```

❌ `/opt/ai-server/` did **NOT exist** - no installation logic copied files there

**stay-awake.service:10**
```ini
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /opt/ai-server/stay-awake-server.py
WorkingDirectory=/opt/ai-server
```

❌ Same problem - path did not exist

**Impact:**
- Services would fail to start with "No such file or directory"
- Even if service files were installed, they would crash immediately

### **Fix Applied:**

✅ Installation functions now **copy Python scripts to `/opt/ai-server/`**
✅ Service files are **generated dynamically** with correct paths
✅ Directory creation happens during installation

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Create installation directory
sudo mkdir -p /opt/ai-server

# Copy Python scripts
sudo cp "${SCRIPT_DIR}/auto-suspend-monitor.py" /opt/ai-server/
sudo cp "${SCRIPT_DIR}/stay-awake-server.py" /opt/ai-server/
sudo chmod +x /opt/ai-server/*.py
```

---

## 🔴 Bug #3: Service Name Inconsistency (HIGH)

### **Problem:**
Three different names used for the same service!

**What install.sh expected (line 86):**
```bash
MANAGED_SERVICE_STAY_AWAKE="ai-stayawake-http.service"
```

**What actually existed in repo:**
```
stay-awake.service  # ❌ WRONG NAME
```

**What ai-auto-suspend.service expected (line 4):**
```ini
After=network.target stay-awake.service
```

**Impact:**
- Service dependencies couldn't be resolved
- `verify-setup.sh` would check for wrong service name
- Race conditions during startup

### **Fix Applied:**

✅ Standardized service name: **`stay-awake.service`**
✅ Updated `install.sh:84` to use correct name
✅ Updated `verify-setup.sh:283,286` to check correct service
✅ Service dependencies now resolve correctly

**Why `stay-awake.service`?**
- Shorter and clearer
- Matches existing service file in repo
- Consistent with systemd naming conventions

---

## 🔴 Bug #4: Python Script Configuration (MEDIUM)

### **Problem:**
`stay-awake-server.py` had hardcoded port instead of using environment variable.

**Original Code (line 21):**
```python
PORT = 9876  # ❌ Hardcoded
```

**Impact:**
- Port configuration from `install.sh` was ignored
- `--stay-awake-port` flag had no effect
- Couldn't run multiple instances with different ports

### **Fix Applied:**

✅ Changed to read from environment variable:
```python
PORT = int(os.getenv('PORT', '9876'))  # ✅ Configurable
```

✅ Service file now passes environment variable:
```ini
Environment="PORT=${STAY_AWAKE_PORT}"
```

**Location:** `stay-awake-server.py:21`

---

## 🔴 Bug #5: No Service Activation in Repair Mode (MEDIUM)

### **Problem:**
Running `install.sh --repair` would not restart/update auto-suspend services.

**Impact:**
- Configuration changes required manual service restart
- Users had to manually run `systemctl daemon-reload`
- Service files could be out of sync with configuration

### **Fix Applied:**

✅ Both `configure_auto_suspend_service()` and `configure_stay_awake_service()` now:
- Always run `systemctl daemon-reload` after updating service files
- Always run `systemctl enable --now` to restart services
- Work correctly in both regular and repair mode

**No separate repair logic needed** - functions are idempotent!

---

## 🔴 Bug #6: Wrong Service Dependencies (LOW)

### **Problem:**
`ai-auto-suspend.service` dependency was wrong:

```ini
After=network.target stay-awake.service
```

But the service was named `ai-stayawake-http.service` in install.sh!

**Impact:**
- Minor - systemd would still start both services
- Could cause race conditions
- Non-deterministic startup order

### **Fix Applied:**

✅ Service name standardized to `stay-awake.service`
✅ Dependencies now resolve correctly
✅ Proper startup ordering: stay-awake → auto-suspend

**Generated Service File:**
```ini
After=network.target ${MANAGED_SERVICE_STAY_AWAKE}
Wants=${MANAGED_SERVICE_STAY_AWAKE}
```

## ✅ How to Test

### 1. Fresh Installation:
```bash
sudo bash install.sh --non-interactive --cpu-only
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ `/opt/ai-server/auto-suspend-monitor.py` created
- ✅ `/opt/ai-server/stay-awake-server.py` created
- ✅ `/etc/systemd/system/ai-auto-suspend.service` created
- ✅ `/etc/systemd/system/stay-awake.service` created
- ✅ Both services enabled and started

### 2. Verify Services:
```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status ai-auto-suspend.service
sudo systemctl status stay-awake.service

# Check stay-awake endpoint
curl http://localhost:9876/health
# Expected: "OK"

# Check auto-suspend logs
sudo journalctl -u ai-auto-suspend.service -f
```

### 3. Test Stay-Awake Functionality:
```bash
# Activate stay-awake for 1 hour
curl "http://localhost:9876/stay?s=3600"
# Expected: "Stay-awake activated for 3600 seconds (1h 0m)"

# Check status
curl http://localhost:9876/status
# Expected: "Stay-awake: active\nRemaining: 0h 59m 55s"
```

### 4. Test Repair Mode:
```bash
# Change configuration
sudo bash install.sh --repair --wait-minutes 45

# Verify service was updated
sudo systemctl cat ai-auto-suspend.service | grep WAIT_MINUTES
# Expected: Environment="WAIT_MINUTES=45"
```

### 5. Verify Auto-Suspend Logic:
```bash
# Monitor auto-suspend behavior
sudo journalctl -u ai-auto-suspend.service -f

# Expected log output:
# "Starting auto-suspend monitor"
# "Configuration:"
# "  Wait time: 30 minutes"
# "  CPU idle threshold: >=90%"
# "  GPU usage threshold: <=10%"
# "  Check interval: 60 seconds"
# "  Check SSH connections: False"
# "  API connections: ignored (do not prevent suspend)"
```

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

**How did this happen?**

During the refactoring to move functions from `install.sh` to helper libraries in `scripts/lib/`, the auto-suspend and stay-awake configuration functions were:

1. ❌ **Removed from install.sh** (good - avoiding duplication)
2. ❌ **Never added to scripts/lib/power.sh** (BAD - created broken state)
3. ❌ **Calls to functions left in install.sh** (broken references)

**The refactoring was incomplete** - functions were deleted but not moved.

**Why wasn't this caught earlier?**

- ✅ ANALYSIS.md correctly identified "Code Duplication Fixed"
- ✅ SUMMARY.md correctly stated "1,017 lines removed"
- ❌ **But actual functionality was never tested**
- ❌ **Syntax checks passed because function calls are valid bash**
- ❌ **Only runtime testing would reveal the missing functions**

**Lesson Learned:**

Refactoring checklist should include:
1. ✅ Identify duplicated code
2. ✅ Move code to libraries
3. ✅ Update source statements
4. ✅ Remove old code
5. ❌ **MISSING: Verify all function calls resolve**
6. ❌ **MISSING: Test installation end-to-end**

## 🚀 Future Improvements

### Recommended Enhancements:

1. **Add Integration Tests:**
   ```bash
   tests/integration/auto_suspend_install.bats
   tests/integration/stay_awake_http.bats
   ```

2. **Add Function Resolution Check:**
   ```bash
   # Verify all called functions exist
   grep -o '\b[a-z_]*()' install.sh | while read func; do
     grep -q "^${func%()}" scripts/lib/*.sh || echo "Missing: $func"
   done
   ```

3. **Add Pre-Commit Hook:**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # .git/hooks/pre-commit
   bash -n install.sh || exit 1
   bash -n install-ollama.sh || exit 1
   for lib in scripts/lib/*.sh; do
     bash -n "$lib" || exit 1
   done
   ```

4. **Document Installation Flow:**
   Create flowchart showing:
   - install.sh → scripts/lib/power.sh → systemd → Python scripts
   - Repair mode flow
   - Service dependencies

5. **Add Logging:**
   ```bash
   # Log installation to file for debugging
   sudo bash install.sh 2>&1 | tee /var/log/localai-install.log
   ```
